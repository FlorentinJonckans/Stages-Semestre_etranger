								<h2>Testimony of a student : Nicolas Juckel</h2>
							</header>
							
							<h4> In which countries would you like or have you been in ? If yes, why ?</h4>
								<ul><li>I went to Japan during 3 months to do my internship in 2016. I decide to go there because I like the culture, the language ...</li></ul>
							
							<h4> What have you prepared in your luggages before you go ?</h4>
								<ul><li>I've prepared a toilet kit (gel, shampoo, toothbrush, flannel ...). Take care at the airport, some objects aren't allowed ! Cloths, my electronic appliances (computer, mobil phone, photo appliance, charger ...) </li></ul>

							<h4>Which languages have you used during your internship ?</h4>
								<ul><li>During my internship, I've mostly used english and thereafter, I've had to speak japanese or even french.</li></ul>
							
							<h4>Have you met any financial issues ? </h4>
								<ul><li>I benefited of the Japanese Stock Exchange of a value of 80 000 yens/month,wheter 600 euros given on my own hands by a member of this japanese school as well as the Blériot Stock Exchange(who is arrived after my internship).</li></ul>
							
							<h4>Which relationships have you had with students and teachers ?</h4>
								<ul><li>I've had a very good relationship with the teachers or the students, "Japanese people" have been very welcoming as soon as I arrived. I didn't expect to have such a very good warm welcoming.</li></ul>
							
							<h4>Have you had some issues to find a housing ?</h4>
								<ul><li>I was living in the school's dormitory for around 80 euros per month.</li></ul>
							
							<h4>How did you live there ?</h4>
								<ul><li>I had to adapt to the japanese student live. Thanks to the help of scholarships , I've learned that we can't live a "french life" in Japan because the price of the french's food are expensive. Meanwhile, I still visited the country in addition to my internship.</li></ul>
							
							<h4>Have you met any other various issues ?</h4>
								<ul><li>Apart from the language barrier with older people who didn't speak english or french I didn't have any issues</li></ul>
